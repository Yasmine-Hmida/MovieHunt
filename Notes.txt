State : is something where once it's updated, the component will change and re-render 
itself to show the new state.

It's usually a good practice to create a separate file that contains all of your API calls.

the useEffect allows you to add side effects to your functions or to your components and define WHEN
they should run.

A context will allow state to be globally available to anything that's within the provided context.
