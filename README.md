## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### API Key Setup

This project requires an API key to access the TMDB service. For security reasons, the API key is **not included** in this repository.

#### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Get your own API key:**

   - Register or sign up at TMDB to obtain your personal API key.

2. **Create a `.env` file:**

   - Create a `.env` file in the project root (you can use `touch` or create it manually):
     ```bash
     touch .env
     ```
   - Open `.env` and replace the placeholder values with your actual API key and base URL:
     ```
     VITE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
     VITE_BASE_URL=https://api.themoviedb.org/3
     ```

3. **Run the project:**

   - The application will automatically load the API key and base URL from your `.env` file.
   - Make sure to keep your `.env` file private and **do not push it** to any public repository.

#### Running the Code

To run the project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yasmine-Hmida/MovieHunt.git
cd MovieHunt
npm install
npm run dev
